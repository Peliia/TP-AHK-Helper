# KTANE Twitch Plays Macro Helper
This is a script written in AutoHotkey that is able to speed up and/or ease typing repetitive commands when playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes on Twitch channels. So far, it includes the basic, most commonly used commands. It also contains one or two features that can help with the KTANE game itself. So far, it can:

- Claim/unclaim modules
- Flip bomb
- Show bomb edges and submit edgework for storing
- Quickly open Expert Profile and Bomb Log folders
- Features hotstrings for alternative input

Because this script is written in AHK, it will only work in Windows-based systems.

## How To Use
Detailed list of commands and their input is shown when executing the script, and can be called again by pressing Ctrl-F1. The script can be (and should be) made to disregard your keystrokes by pressing Ctrl-H, Ctrl-X terminates the script completely. All inputs triggering the script are intercepted; the system does not see them.

Some commands expect a parameter to be entered, typically a number assigned by the game to a module in question. Once the command is triggered, simply type the number (its input is intercepted) and press Space.

The script offers *hotstrings* as an alternative to hotkeys. Simply type the keyword of the command and press space, and the keyword disappears and command is triggered.

The script triggers type the TP commands indiscriminantly, whereever your text cursor is pointing. Make sure to have your text input focus on the Twitch Chat window.

## Download
The script is also available as a stand-alone binary file. Its capabilities are the same as the script on its own, but the system does not need to install the AHK runtime libraries.
